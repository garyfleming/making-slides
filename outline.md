# Making Slides

Premise: Slides are a way to help tell your story; they are not the story itself.

What this is not: Literally making slides. Powerpoint, google docs etc.

## Things we need to cover:

* Don’t put too much text on a slide. People will read it rather than listen to your story.
* Vary the content of the slides. Headline. Bullet points. Images.
* Simple. Visually consistent.
* The deck has a story arc: beginning, middle, end.
* Also: title, conclusion, and thank you slides (with your details).
* Everything I’m saying has limits. There are times to break most of these rules (cold opens, for example); don’t worry too much about those yet.
* Visuals are there for you too, to remind you of how the story goes.
* Practical style stuff: contrast. Readability. Size of text.

## Timing (45-55 minutes)

Intro (5 mins) - What this is and isn’t. Why it’s important.

Examples of bad slides (5-10 mins?). Discussion on why they’re not good. How people feel about them. What they’d change. Possibly get them in pairs to work on how they’d change a specific text heavy slide?

Story arcs (5 mins) - explain (TODO)

Main part of workshop (20-25 mins?): Give them a well-known story, like a fairytale, like Little Red Riding Hood. Get them to think about what the main parts of the story are. Give each of them a bunch of index cards. 5 slides to tell the story as best as possible, plus an additional conclusion slide. Encourage visual diversity without information density. Get them to pair up and explain their version. Give feedback to each other.
